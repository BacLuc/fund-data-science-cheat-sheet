\section{Log likelihood estimation}
\small
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Reorder equation that it consists of nice products.

	\item Take the log

	\item Don't forget to negate it that we can maximize the function by minimizing
		the negative log likelihood.

	\item Set to 0 and solve for the variable to estimate
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Poisson}
The MLE for the poisson distribution is the mean of the observations.
