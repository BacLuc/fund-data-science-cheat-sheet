\section{Principal Component Analysis}
Project data into lower dimensions while still capturing the essence.\\ e.g.by
standardising data or by removing correlated features.\\ Compute the covariance
matrix $X^{T}X$\\ Compute the eigenvectors of $X^{T}X$ to identify the principal
components.\\ k-th principal component = eigenvector for the k-th largest eigenvalue\\
Decide on how many principal components you want to keep.
